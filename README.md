# Ontario649 Lotto Predict

A collection of scripts to collect and process previous winning lottery numbers

A Keras LSTM model is trained using the collected data, and while the
logic does seem to make sense, it does not predict numbers correctly.
More work is needed to correctly train the model and possibly set up
more layers of the neural-network.
